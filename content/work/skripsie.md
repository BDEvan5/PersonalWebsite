In the final year of my undergraduate degree in Mechatronic engineering at Stellenbosch University, I desgined and evaluated a motion capture system.

The project aimed to use stereo vision to detect the location of a marker and I measured how different parameters affected the error. 

While it wasn't my best piece of work, I received 81% for it.
