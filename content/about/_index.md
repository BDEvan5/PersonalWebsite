<!-- ## Introduction -->

I am an enthusiastic person who likes to learn new things.
I am a Christian who believes the Bible is the Word of God.
I live in Stellenbosch in South Africa.


<!-- ## Background -->

I grew up in East London in the Eastern Cape in South Africa.
In 2016, after completing school, I moved to Stellenbosch to study mechatronic engineering. 
I completed my degree in the standard four year, graduating in December 2019.
In 202 I started a masters in electronic engineering with the autonomous vehicles research group.
In 2021, my masters project was upgraded to a PhD.
On the 1st of November, I submitted my PhD dissertation for examination and expect a result early in 2023.


## Research

My engineering research is focused on autonomous software stacks for F1Tenth racing.
My PhD titled, "Accelerating deep reinforcement learning for autonomous racing", studied how current learnign formulations for racing can be improved.
I am interested in autonomous systems, machine learning (especially reinforcement learning), perception, planning and control architectures and robot safety.
